/**
 * memory-coordination (v8.0 round-11, Memory-as-shared-substrate, 3 workers)
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Calibrated spread: TODO(calibration) — fill frontierAvg / budgetAvg / gap from
 * the round-11 sweep (anchors: claude-opus-4.8, codex-5.5 vs pi-deepseek-flash,
 * claude-haiku). Ship gate: frontierAvg − budgetAvg ≥ 0.2. Target ~0.3 → 0.85.
 *
 * A SWARM-MECHANICS scenario where the bottleneck is shared memory, NOT model
 * capability: each sub-task is individually trivial for any decent model, but the
 * SYSTEM only succeeds if the team uses swarm memory as shared infrastructure to
 * transfer knowledge between filesystem-isolated workers.
 *
 * Worker 0 (the INVESTIGATOR) is seeded — on its sandbox ONLY, via `seed.exec`
 * (which the runner runs in worker 0's sandbox alone) — with an incident dossier
 * (`/workspace/dossier/incident-INC-4417.md`). It must extract SIX structured
 * findings (incident id, root-cause commit SHA, the service that failed, the
 * rollback target tag, the on-call engineer, and the customer-impact minutes) and
 * PUBLISH each to SWARM memory (scope swarm, via its memory tools) under a shared
 * channel tag, plus write its own findings file.
 *
 * Workers 1 and 2 (the SYNTHESIZERS) have NO copy of the dossier — their sandboxes
 * are fresh (seed.exec never touches them), so the ONLY path to the findings is
 * RETRIEVING worker 0's swarm memory. Each writes a deliverable that must COMBINE
 * MULTIPLE of worker 0's stored facts:
 *   - Worker 1 writes a remediation ticket combining the incident id + the
 *     root-cause SHA + the rollback target tag + the failed service.
 *   - Worker 2 writes a status-page postmortem combining the incident id + the
 *     on-call engineer + the customer-impact minutes + the failed service.
 * Neither deliverable's facts can be produced without first reading worker 0's
 * memory: a swarm that does not use memory as shared infra simply CANNOT transfer
 * the knowledge (workers 1/2 have no local source).
 *
 * Reuses the cross-worker `workers: 3` + `seed.exec` (writable scratch dir on
 * worker 0) + `dependsOn` fan-out machinery from `cross-worker-invent`, and the
 * per-fact graded-recall pattern from `memory-distractor` (here applied to a
 * cross-worker memory handoff), plus the full-roster agentic judge (v8.0 §4 —
 * reads ANY worker's sandbox + session logs) for the provenance grade.
 *
 * Requires an embedding key in evals/.env (EMBEDDING_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)
 * for the swarm memory store/search the worker-0→workers-1/2 handoff relies on —
 * same as cross-worker-invent / distributed-audit.
 *
 * Grading:
 *   - `correctness` (weight 3): a single inline graded check (factsRecalled-style,
 *       `score = matched / total`) over BOTH downstream deliverables. Each of
 *       worker 1's four required facts and worker 2's four required facts is a
 *       distinctive regex anchored on the dossier-derived VALUE (which appears in
 *       NO prompt). Eight sub-facts total → fine-grained partial credit so a team
 *       that transferred half the facts ranks below one that transferred them all
 *       and above one that transferred none. A worker that never read memory writes
 *       a deliverable missing every value-bearing fact and scores 0 on its half.
 *   - `memory-coordination` (weight 1, custom, agentic — depends on Phase 4): a
 *       judge reads worker 0's sandbox + session logs to confirm it WROTE structured
 *       memory (the facts derived from the dossier), then reads workers 1/2 sandboxes
 *       to confirm THEIR values MATCH worker 0's stored facts AND were
 *       RETRIEVED-not-guessed: the values are absent from workers 1/2 prompts, present
 *       in memory, and the transcript shows a memory search before the deliverable was
 *       written. It grades the COORDINATION (did the value propagate via memory), not
 *       exact fact correctness (the deterministic check does that).
 *
 * Anti-gaming (checklist applied to THIS scenario):
 *   - The source dossier is seeded on worker 0 ONLY (seed.exec runs in worker 0's
 *     sandbox alone). Workers 1 and 2 have NO local copy — `fileAbsentOnWorker`-style
 *     isolation is structural, not just by convention — so the ONLY path to the
 *     facts is retrieving worker 0's swarm memory. A swarm that ignores memory cannot
 *     transfer the knowledge at all.
 *   - The fact VALUES (the SHA, the rollback tag, the engineer name, the impact
 *     minutes, etc.) appear in NONE of the task prompts — only in the seeded dossier
 *     on worker 0. Workers 1/2's prompts name which FIELDS to combine, never the
 *     values. Echoing the prompt or guessing scores 0 on the per-fact checks.
 *   - The dossier values are deliberately specific and non-guessable (a 40-hex SHA,
 *     a `v`-prefixed semver rollback tag, a distinctive engineer name, an odd impact
 *     figure), and the dossier embeds RED-HERRING values (a superseded commit, an
 *     earlier rollback candidate, a secondary service, a different responder) so a
 *     worker 0 that grabs the wrong field publishes a wrong fact and tanks the
 *     downstream checks — discrimination on careful extraction, not just transfer.
 *   - Each downstream deliverable requires COMBINING multiple stored facts (4 each),
 *     so a worker can't "win" by surfacing a single value — it must read several of
 *     worker 0's memories and assemble them.
 *   - The agentic memory-coordination judge cross-checks provenance across all three
 *     sandboxes + session logs, so a value that landed by coincidence (without a
 *     memory write on worker 0 or a memory read on workers 1/2) is not rewarded.
 *   - The grading rubric / per-fact patterns are NOT shown to any worker.
 *
 * Answer key (mirror of the seeded dossier below — keep them in lockstep; if the
 * dossier changes, update these patterns AND the dossier heredoc together):
 *   incident id            = INC-4417
 *   root-cause commit SHA  = 9f3c1a7e2b4d6f8a0c2e1d3b5a7c9e1f0a2b4c6d  (NOT the
 *                            superseded 0011223344556677889900aabbccddeeff001122)
 *   failed service         = checkout-orchestrator     (NOT the secondary
 *                            "inventory-sync" mentioned as merely degraded)
 *   rollback target tag    = v2.19.4                    (NOT the earlier candidate
 *                            v2.18.0 that was rejected)
 *   on-call engineer       = Priya Natarajan            (NOT the secondary
 *                            responder "Marcus Feld" who only ack'd)
 *   customer-impact minutes = 73
