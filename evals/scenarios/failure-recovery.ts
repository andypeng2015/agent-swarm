/**
 * failure-recovery (v8.0 round-11, Swarm-mechanics / failure recovery, 3 workers)
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Calibrated spread: TODO(calibration) — fill frontierAvg / budgetAvg / gap from
 * the round-11 sweep (anchors: claude-opus-4.8, codex-5.5 vs pi-deepseek-flash,
 * claude-haiku). Ship gate: frontierAvg − budgetAvg ≥ 0.2. Target ~0.25 → 0.8.
 *
 * A SWARM-MECHANICS scenario: each sub-task is individually trivial (sum eight
 * signed numbers), but the SYSTEM only succeeds if the team detects that a
 * teammate's contribution is WRONG and recovers from it. The bottleneck is the
 * swarm (shared-memory handoff + cross-worker verification + recovery from a
 * poisoned worker), NOT single-model arithmetic.
 *
 * Three workers in a verify-and-recover pipeline. Worker 1 is POISONED at seed
 * time via the new `seed.workerFailures` primitive (NOT promptable — the poison is
 * injected straight into worker 1's sandbox before any task runs) so that it
 * produces a confidently-WRONG intermediate total. The consumer (worker 2) must
 * VERIFY worker 1's claim against ground truth — which is independently derivable
 * from worker 0's faithfully-published source ledger — CATCH the discrepancy, and
 * publish the CORRECTED total. The correct final answer is reachable ONLY if the
 * swarm notices worker 1 is wrong and recovers; a consumer that blindly trusts
 * worker 1 propagates the poison and scores 0 on correctness.
 *
 *   - Worker 0 (SOURCE, faithful): reads a seeded transaction ledger off its
 *     sandbox (eight signed deltas), and PUBLISHES the full ledger verbatim into
 *     swarm memory under `${LEDGER_TAG}` so the rest of the team — whose sandboxes
 *     are isolated from worker 0's disk — can independently recompute from it. Its
 *     job is honest; it is the source of ground truth.
 *   - Worker 1 (RECONCILER, POISONED): is asked to compute the NET total of the
 *     ledger and publish it under `${TOTAL_TAG}` + write it to `${W1_TOTAL_FILE}`.
 *     But `seed.workerFailures` has ALREADY planted a confidently-wrong total
 *     (`${POISON_TOTAL}`) into worker 1's sandbox AND deleted its memory-search
 *     tooling shim, so a poisoned worker that trusts its own pre-planted file (or
 *     fumbles the broken tooling) emits the wrong number. Worker 1 is the broken
 *     teammate the swarm must cope with.
 *   - Worker 2 (VERIFIER, recovers): is told NOT to trust the reconciler blindly.
 *     It retrieves BOTH the source ledger (worker 0, `${LEDGER_TAG}`) and the
 *     reconciler's claimed total (`${TOTAL_TAG}`), RE-DERIVES the net total itself
 *     from the ledger, and writes a verification report to `${VERIFIED_FILE}` on
 *     its OWN sandbox stating the verified correct total, whether the reconciler's
 *     claim matched, and — if not — the correction.
 *
 * Reuses the cross-worker `workers` + `dependsOn` + swarm-memory-handoff machinery
 * from `cross-worker-invent` / `relay-pipeline` (no shared disk; every hop is a
 * memory handoff) and the `seed.exec` heredoc machinery from `bug-ladder`,
 * generalized to a verify-and-recover topology with a seed-time poisoned worker.
 *
 * Requires an embedding key in evals/.env (EMBEDDING_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)
 * for the swarm memory store/search every hop relies on.
 *
 * Grading (v2): this is a SWARM eval — the swarm BEHAVIOR (did the team detect +
 * recover from a broken teammate) is what we measure, so it OUTWEIGHS raw
 * final-answer correctness. (Round-3 sweep: correctness saturated at 1.00 for all
 * tiers — everyone recovered the number — while the recovery judge separated opus
 * 0.90 vs budget 0.50; weighting recovery 3x makes that the dominant signal.)
 *   - `correctness` (weight 1, GRADED deterministic): the verifier's report must
 *       carry the GROUND-TRUTH net total (553), NOT the poisoned value (488).
 *       Partial credit over three sub-facts — (a) the correct net total present,
 *       (b) the poisoned value NOT propagated as the final answer, (c) the
 *       discrepancy/correction surfaced — so a report that recovered the number
 *       but never flagged the poison ranks between a full recovery and a blind
 *       propagation. None of the ground-truth values appear in any prompt.
 *   - `failure-recovery` (weight 3, AGENTIC judge): the judge inspects ALL worker
 *       sandboxes + session logs + the roster to determine, causally, (a) whether
 *       the poisoned/wrong contribution was DETECTED (a worker flagged the
 *       discrepancy) and (b) whether it was CORRECTED / re-derived vs silently
 *       PROPAGATED into the final answer.
 *
 * GATES (binary must-pass): tasks-completed (synthetic, runner-prepended) +
 * the verifier's report EXISTS on worker 2 (final-deliverable-exists).
 *
 * Anti-gaming (checklist applied to THIS scenario):
 *   - Ground-truth values (correct total 553, credits 770, debits 217) appear in
 *     NO prompt — they live only in the seeded ledger on worker 0's sandbox, so
 *     the verifier must recompute from the ledger it retrieved. Echoing the prompt
 *     scores 0.
 *   - The poison is injected via `seed.workerFailures` (seed-time, sandbox-level),
 *     NOT through any prompt — no prompt mentions the poisoned value 488 or that
 *     worker 1 is broken, so a config cannot "know" to distrust worker 1 by
 *     reading the task text; it must distrust on EVIDENCE (the recompute mismatch).
 *   - The correct total is INDEPENDENTLY DERIVABLE by a diligent consumer (sum the
 *     eight ledger deltas worker 0 published), so recovery is achievable without
 *     worker 1 — but only if the consumer actually re-derives rather than relays.
 *   - The poisoned value 488 is a confidently-wrong NET total that is not a partial
 *     sum of the ledger and does not collide (as a substring) with any real figure
 *     (553/770/217), so the correctness check's "poison NOT propagated" sub-fact is
 *     unambiguous.
 *   - The grading rubric / per-fact patterns are NOT shown to any worker.
 *   - The agentic failure-recovery judge verifies recovery CAUSALLY from the
 *     sandboxes + session logs (did a worker recompute and flag the mismatch?), so
 *     a report that happens to contain 553 without any detection behavior is not
 *     rewarded on the recovery dimension.
 *
 * Answer key (mirror of the seeded ledger below — keep in lockstep):
 *   ledger deltas  = +120, -45, +300, -80, +210, -65, +140, -27   (8 entries)
 *   correct NET total            = 553   (ground truth — appears in NO prompt)
 *   total credits (sum positive) = 770
 *   total debits  (abs sum neg)  = 217
 *   POISONED total (seed-injected into worker 1, WRONG) = 488   (in NO prompt)
